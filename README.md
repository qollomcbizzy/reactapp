Simple React Application for backend and frontend using react and mongodb

1.use command below to create a react application
### `create-react-app`
2.created a server folder
3.We will start by creating our database Schemas. Note, we are using mongoose, a MongoDB connection utility. Letâ€™s touch some files:

### `touch server/models/Article.js`
### `touch server/models/User.js`

We will be using two Schemas Article and User.Article represents articles and User represents users


Editted the two files for articles and user schemas
Create controllers

Looking at the article.ctrl.js ,we have CRUD functions and helper functions: getArticle, addArticle, getAll, clapArticle, commentArticle.

we create some basic CRUD like get and set for handle User data

***Create Routes***
We are going to create our routes. Run the following commands:

article.js will hold routes for our articles endpoint and user.js will hold routes for our users.

We will create an index route function that will export all routes(routes/article.jsand routes/user.js) in our app.

touch server/routes/index.js
